<p>Example Program</p>

<p>Programs are extensions of the main OS class (which is called when 
    HyperTerMinaL boots). They must be placed in the /programs folder, and they 
    must have a folder, .js file and .html file which match the name of the program.
    For example, in this test program the files are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>/programs/test/test.html (this page)</li>
    <li>/programs/test/test.js</li>
</ul>

<p>The 'LOAD' command expects these files to be located in the correct
    place with the correct name. It will load the .js file and then attempt to
    'open' the main page.</p>

<p>To unload a program, use the 'RESET' command, unless the loaded program
    has its own exit function. Note: Refreshing the page will also unload a program.</p>

<p>Use the command 'EXAMPLE' to see and example command from a loaded program running.</p>
