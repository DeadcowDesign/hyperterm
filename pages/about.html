<h2>What is the DDOS?</h2>
<p>The DDOS is an answer to the question: 'What happens when web developers get 
    bored?'. It evolved from a desire to create a website that looked like one of
    the old green-screen, dumb terminals. That set me wondering how practical it
    would be to have a website that <i>behaved</i> like an old green-screen terminal.
