<h1>About me:</h1>
<p>
    I have been a computer programmer, professionally, for over 10 years.
    I was lucky to cut my teeth as a Junior Server-side Developer at Jaywing, 
    at the time the largest Digital Agency outside of London, before moving on 
    to Plusnet as a Senior Client-Side developer, then Castus as a Senior 
    Server-Side developer,before my current role as Web Developer at the 
    University of Derby.

    I am a passionate engineer, interested in pushing the envelope of web-technology,
    and seeing how much can be done with as little as possible (hence some of the
    ethos behind this site), and in making the sophisticated seem simple. I believe 
    that the web should be accessible, and that technology should not come at 
    the expense of people's ability to access it. I believe in a free and
    open web.

    I have a <a href="https://github.com/DeadcowDesign">Github</a> - where the 
    source code for this site is freely available in a repository under MIT license
    should you, for some reason, want it, and some other bits and bobs (I would
    recommend Lunar - a lightweight, minimal configuration, PHP framework)
</p>
<br>
<p>
    I have a <a href="https://codepen.io/deadcowdesign">Codepen</a> which has some
    nonsense on it.

    I am on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deadcowdesign/">LinkedIn</a>.
    I have no other Social Media presence, which is very hipster of me. Social Media
    companies creep me out.
