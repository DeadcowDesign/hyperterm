<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
    I've been a Web Developer for around 15 years, from the days of Geocities and BBS boards, to Twitter and Facebook.
    In that time I've been privileged to work for some of the largest and most prestigious companies in the UK and Internationally 
    including Senior positions at both Jaywing, and Plusnet. I currently work as Senior Developer for the University of Derby.

    I'm interested in experimenting with what we can do with the minimum, visualy, while still building software that pushes the
    boundaries of what the web can be. I am enamoured by brutalist and retro websites.
