<h1>About this website and me</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I've been a Web Developer for around 15 years, from the days of Geocities and BBS boards, to Twitter and Facebook.
    In that time I've been privileged to work for some of the largest and most prestigious companies in the UK and Internationally.

    Starting my professional career at Jaywing as a server-side developer, I cut my teeth on projects for firms such as
    Castrol, Yorkshire Water, First Direct, Axa Insurance, creating cutting edge software which regularly pushed the
    boundaries of what was possible on the web at the time. From Jaywing, I moved to Plusnet as a Senior Client-side engineer
    on the marketing team working in an Agile environment within a multi-disciplinary department on enterprise-level systems.
    After three and a half years at Plusnet I moved to Castus, where I worked as a Lead Server-side engineer until life took
    an unexpected turn and I moved down to Derby. I currently work as Senior Web Developer at the University of Derby - a full
    stack role, delivering innovative website solutions for both current and prospective students.
