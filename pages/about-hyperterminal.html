<h1>About this website</h1>
<hr>
<h2>But why, though?</h2>
<p>
    Because I thought it would be fun to have a website that looked like an old computer,
    but not just an old computer; a properly <i>old</i> computer. I've seen sites before
    that have been made to look like old DOS systems (in fact there's an excellent
    framework called <a href="http://kristopolous.github.io/BOOTSTRA.386/">Bootstrap.386</a>), but
    I've never seen one that looked like a green-screen.
</p>
<p>
    The layout and CSS for the site is dead simple - the colours on screen are based
    on actual phosphor colours of old CRT monitors (see the 'HELP' page for more
    information on changing the site colours). It uses the VT323 font from Google,
    and honestly, that's about it.

    When I built the site originally, it was just a standard website, albeit with
    green-screen aesthetics. I put the little flashing cursor and command bar at the
    bottom just for a little visual flourish, but that got me thinking:
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Can I build a site that <i>behaves</i> like an old dumb-terminal?
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Turns out the answer is complex.
