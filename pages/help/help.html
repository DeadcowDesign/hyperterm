<h2>Using the System:</h2>
<p>The <i>HyperTerMinaL</i> operates on a very simple system. All commands consist of 
    two parts - a command, and a parameter. Commands are a single word, followed
    by a space, followed by a parameter which may be one or more words. 
    For example, to change the OS colour, type 'COLOUR AMBER'. The command is 
    'COLOUR' and the parameter is 'AMBER'.
</p>
<p>A complete list of commands is available by typing 'HELP COMMANDS'</p>
<h2>Navigation:</h2>
<p>
    To navigate the site, use the 'GOTO' command followed by either a page name, or
    a link number. For example to visit the following link: <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>
    you would type GOTO 1 which will open Google in a new tab.
</p>

    To get a list of pages on the site type the command 'LIST'
